        <h2 id="dreams">Do dreams come true ?</h2>
        <h6>Posted on 17 January,2011 </h6>
        
        <p>Have you ever dreamt of achieving something in your life. I did, as I dreamt off I use to wonder about achieving the dreams. How does a thought in a mind became a reality on tomorrow. We think today, then we became that tomorroww. Certainly you got it. Your thoughts are driving you. Your thoughts drive you through the journey of realisation of your dream into a reality.</p>
        <P> So next comes what can you do ? As thoughts are creating the realities of tomorrow, how can you and me take the advantage of it. Right question... In this context we have to understand the power that the creator has given the man. It is not a supernatural power that only some people are given. He has given this power to every man in the Earth. And that it is to control his own thoughts. One who use and exercise it reap its benefits.  The innate ability of human being to control his own thoughts are quite fascinating...</p>
        <p>Now lets look at how this ability has influenced people in past. When Prophet Mohammed (S.A.W) started sharing his ideas of Islam to the bedouins of Arabs. They started calling him as a mad man and he disrespecting what the grandparents has taught them..But he firmly beleived that he was chosen as Prophet for the World and coming generation by the creator. So he stood stiff on what he beleived. Thus now Saudi Arabia became one of the strongest Islamic Country in the world...</p>

    <p> Have you ever thought of why we are learning so much in our education. The answer is to become good at some skill which can be provide you a good carer. When it comes to getting selected for a job, Interview is a crucial step in it. We must be able to pass through the bridge caled Interview.</p>
    
    <p> What all are the things that you have to look for, while appearing for an Interview. Let's discuss it more. 
    <ol>
        <li>Groom yourself before the Interview, so that you look good.</li>
        <li> Just undrstand that you have come across a man and you are a salesman who came to sell a product that is you..</li>
        <li>Don't think about yourself in the discussion, rather think about the person you are talking with. Try to understand whether the company is a right fit for you ? </li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    
    <h2 id="desire">What do you desire most in your life.?</h2>
    
    <p>Hello friends, today we are going to discuss about the desires in your heart.What would you say if someone ask you a desire you eagelt want..</p>
    <p>It is diffferent from one man to another, but we all have desire which need to be fulfilled. Just like the thinking , have you ever thought where are these desires in our mind are coming from? If you just ponder over the working of desire, you will understand that desires are inspired from emotions. The emotions we create is different for different people in different situations. If we closely take a look at the desires which are fulfilled, we understand that these are connected emotionally too. </p>
    <p>So remember ine thing when you desire, the desire shouldn't be an ordinary desire. It should be in harmony with people and inspired by emotions, which inturn, turn in to reality..</p>
